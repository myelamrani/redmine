== CKEditor customization

=== Plugins

You can download plugins from {Add-ons Repository}[http://ckeditor.com/addons/plugins/all].
To activate the plugin you have to copy the plugin directory into assets/ckeditor-contrib/plugins and restart Redmine, then configure toolbar settings.

=== Skins

You can select third-party skins placed in assets/ckeditor-contrib/skins directory.

== Migration notes

This plugin stores contents in HTML format and renders as is.
If you have old contents, these look weird.

You can use {redmine_per_project_formatting}[https://github.com/a-ono/redmine_per_project_formatting] plugin for backward compatibility or execute redmine_ckeditor:migrate task for migrating old text to HTML.
    rake redmine_ckeditor:migrate RAILS_ENV=production [PROJECT=project_identifier1,project_identifier2] [FORMAT=textile]
